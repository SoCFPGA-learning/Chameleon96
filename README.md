# SocFGPA - Chameleon96

This repository is where I store my contributions to the Chameleon96 board community https://t.me/Chameleon96.

The Chameleon96™ board, based on Intel® Cyclone V SoC FPGA, is a member of 96Boards community and complies with Consumer Edition board specifications (excluding MIPI SDI Interface). 

The Chameleon96™ features Dual ARM Cortex-A9 processors, 110K Logic Elements FPGA fabric, 512 MB DDR3 and a set of peripherals allow direct interfacing and connecting to MMC/SD card, HDMI out, USB, WLAN and BLE. Two expansion connectors provide additional interfaces to cameras, USB, UARTs, I2C, SPI and GPIOs.

Most of the examples and tutorials shown here should be highly compatible with any Cyclone V SoC FPGA like the Terasic DE10-Nano.

The folders contain the following information:

* **Tutorials**: Basic tutorials for learning how to use Quartus (Block diagram editor and Verilog code editor), Platform designer (Qsys), Intel SoC EDS (Embedded Development Suite).
  * Upload a ready made blink example core. 
  * Design and compile from scratch your very first FPGA core consisting of two led blinks at different frequencies. 
  * Design and compile an FPGA core using the LOAN I/O function to use I/O normally assigned to the HPS from the FPGA side.
  * Working with the SD card and preloader generation .
  * Design and compile an FPGA core using the LOAN I/O function to use pins from the low speed 40 pin connector (an external button is used to switch on leds).

* **Projects**: Contains different interesting projects

  * Knight Rider led effect
  * VGA Adapter 64 color test pattern generator

* **Templates**

  * Project Templates: Contains Quartus project templates

  * Preloaders: Contain ready made preloaders
